# Github Dependency Checker

This app searches through a GitHub organization and all its repositories to build a dependency tree graph. The graph is then rendered to visualize the dependencies between repositories within the organization.

## Prerequisites

You need a .env file with these variables:

```
TOKEN=token_with_read_rights_for_org
ORG_NAME=your_org_name
```
