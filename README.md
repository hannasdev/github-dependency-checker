# Github Dependency Checker

This app searches through a github organisation and all its repositories, to build a graph dependency tree. This tree is then rendered, in order to visualise the dependencies between repositories inside the organisation.

## Prerequisites

You need a .env file with these variables:

```
TOKEN=token_with_read_rights_for_org
ORG_NAME=your_org_name
```
